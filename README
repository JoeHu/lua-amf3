AMF3 encoding/decoding library for Lua
Copyright (C) 2012-2013 Arseny Vakhrushev <arseny.vakhrushev at gmail dot com>


Description
-----------

The library provides two functions:

amf3.encode(obj)

- Encodes 'obj' into an AMF3 representation and returns it as a string.
- References are fully supported.

amf3.decode(str [, pos])

- Decodes an object from 'str' and returns it as the first value.
- An optional argument specifies offset (>=0) in the string.
- The number of bytes read from the string is returned as the second value.
- The AMF3 Object type is decoded into a table with additional '_class' (class name)
  and '_data' (externalizable object's data) fields when applicable.


Installation
------------

* Linux, OSX (Darwin):

    sudo make install

* FreeBSD:

    sudo gmake install

If you need specific adjustments, please refer to 'Makefile' and 'config'.
For example, you might want to change the installation prefix in place:

    sudo PREFIX=/your/path make install
