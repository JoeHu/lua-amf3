AMF3 encoding/decoding library for Lua
Copyright (C) 2012-2013 Arseny Vakhrushev <arseny.vakhrushev at gmail dot com>


Description
-----------

The library provides two functions:

amf3.encode(obj)

- Encodes 'obj' into an AMF3 representation and returns it as a string.
- A table with plain numeric keys 1..n without gaps is encoded as a dense AMF3
  array (sequence) with the corresponding indices 0..n-1. Otherwise, the keys
  are converted into strings and the table is encoded as an associative AMF3
  array.

amf3.decode(str [, pos])

- Decodes an object from 'str' and returns it as the first value.
- An optional argument specifies offset (>=0) in the string.
- The number of bytes read from the string is returned as the second value.
- The AMF3 Object type is converted into a table with the additional '_class'
  (class name) and '_data' (externalizable object's data) fields set when
  applicable.


Installation
------------

* Linux, OSX (Darwin):

    sudo make install

* FreeBSD:

    sudo gmake install

If you need specific adjustments, please refer to 'Makefile' and 'config'.
For example, you might want to change the installation prefix in place:

    sudo PREFIX=/your/path make install
