Description
-----------

The library provides two functions:

amf3.encode(obj)

- Encodes 'obj' into an AMF3 representation and returns it as a string;
- References are fully supported.

amf3.decode(str [, pos])

- Decodes an object from 'str' and returns it as the first value;
- An optional argument specifies the position starting from 0 where decoding begins;
- The number of bytes read from the string is returned as the second value;
- All AMF3 types are fully supported except for OBJECT (please use ARRAY instead).


Installation
------------

* Linux, OSX (Darwin):

	sudo make install

* FreeBSD:

	sudo gmake install

If you need specific adjustments, please refer to 'Makefile' and 'config'.
For example, you might want to change the installation prefix in place:

	sudo PREFIX=/your/path make install
